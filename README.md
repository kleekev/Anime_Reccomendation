# Anime_Reccomendation
Using myanimelist database from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist, I created a recommendation system.
Using DocumentReader. I read the cvs file and tried to filter out any unnecessary columns
In order to determine which anime is best, I used a point system. 
Depending on which genres that the user picks, I gave a point for each genre that matched and gave points based on popularity
It would then output the anime with the most points.
