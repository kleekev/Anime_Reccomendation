Anime Recommender
Instructions: Just run the main file and it will print out a set of
instructions for the user to follow

Description: The goal is to try and recommend the best anime for the user
based on the input on what genre that the user wants. It will ask the user
each genre and the user types in "yes" or "no" to decide which genre
they would like to pick.

This project contains Document Search and Recommendations. From the internet,
I downloaded a cvs file that contains information about anime from the
myanimelist website and read the document in order to pick the best anime.

When creating the algorithm for the recommendation, I realized it was
going to be a bit too much to try and implement multiple different
restrictions with the time I had left, so I just stuck to genres. If I had
more time or more people, I would try to implement more restrictions in order
to make sure that the recommendation is the best.

This is where I got the cvs file from
